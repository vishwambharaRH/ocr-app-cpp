# OCR App in C++

Working on translating all the OCR app code from Python to C++. This project aims to leverage C++'s performance advantages for image processing and OCR tasks.
Also Python bindings will be provided for easy integration with existing Python codebases.

## Current Status
- Initial setup and project structure completed.
- Basic image loading and preprocessing functions implemented in C++.
- OCR engine integration in progress.

## Completion Timeline
- Target completion by end of Jan 2025
- Regular updates will be provided in the repository.

> [!NOTE]
> I do not know proper C++ (yet), hence any changes in the code that I can make
> would be very limited and rudimentary. Contributions from C++ developers are welcome!
